Hexdump
=======

This project is intended to be an implementation of a simple hex viewer/editor using as wide a
range of programming languages and technologies as possible. In effect this is a "Hello, World"
project. It is a place to explore different programming environments and methods without the
distraction of any particular "important" application.

Each folder in this project provides a hex viewer/editor using a language or technology as
specified by the folder's name. See the README files in each folder for more information. The
program implemented in each case need not be identical. In some environments it may be a highly
mature application replete with features of all kinds. In other environments it may be a very
minimal utility. In still other environments you might find a library, or a DSL, or some other
artifact more appropriate for that environment than the traditional command line utility one
might first envision.

Despite the simplicity of the demonstration program, many interesting features could be
implemented depending on the time and interest of the developer. Indeed, it is the point of this
project to encourage such exploration. For example

+ A simple command line utility to display the contents of a file in hex or in other similar
  ways. Such an application would be similar to the Unix 'od' program.

+ A GUI application with features for searching for hex strings and/or editing the data in the
  file.

+ A library that allows easy manipulation of raw data files (searching, regular expression
  matching, etc, of raw data).

+ A program that allows comparisions, diffs, merges, etc of raw binary data.

The programs in the hexdump project can also be intentionally small and trivial. In that regard
they could serve as examples for first time programmers using the given technology.
